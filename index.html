We believe that a stable home environment is fundamental to personal growth and community development.</p>

    Add water storage and hardware option under the services section on the html file and relevant style to the CSS file
    
    I'll add a water storage and hardware option to your services section in the HTML file and also update the CSS to match the existing style. Let me handle this for you:
    
    
    HTML Update
    Code 
    
    CSS Update
    Code 
    I've added the requested water storage and hardware options to your Complete Homes website. Here's what I've done:
    
    HTML Updates: Added two new service cards to the services section:
    Water Storage Solutions: For water tanks and storage systems
    Hardware & Tools: For home maintenance and repair items
    CSS Updates: Enhanced the service card styling to:
    Ensure consistent card heights with flex display
    Improve responsiveness for the expanded services grid
    Add subtle color enhancement to the service headings
    For the images, I've used placeholder images that you can replace with actual photos of water storage solutions and hardware tools. The design matches your existing style while gracefully expanding to include the new services.
