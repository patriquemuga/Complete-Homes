                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Complete Homes is a community-oriented association established in 2023 with the aim of supporting families and individuals with essential household items and financial assistance. We believe that a stable home environment is fundamental to personal growth and community development.</p>
                    <p>Our association was formed by a group of community leaders who recognized the growing need for accessible household essentials and emergency financial support. Since our foundation, we have helped over 500 families create complete and comfortable homes.</p>
                    <p>Through the generous contributions of our members and partners, we maintain a diverse inventory of household items that are available to our members, ensuring that everyone has access to the essentials needed for a functional home. From the profits earned, we also take care of the Elderly and The Needy in the community</p>
                    <p>We also focus on women empowerment. The program supports spiritual growth, social development, health, and financial progress. It includes physical training sessions. These sessions help women build social skills and income related skills. The goal is balanced growth across personal strength, community engagement, and economic stability.</p>
